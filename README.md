# Simple Discord bot rewriting Twitter links to TwitFix ones

## How to use it

1. Create a new discord bot ([Developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications))
1. Clone this repository or download the zip file
   - (Unpack the zip)
1. You need to install `Node`, and `yarn` if you haven't already
1. Install `typescript`
1. Create an `.env` file following the `.envexample` file and replace `your_token` with the your token (never share this token with anyone!)
1. Run `yarn` to install all needed packages
1. Run `yarn start` to start the bot

## Bugs

The bot is so simple that the only thing which could break is finding links in a message so if it didn't respond to a message you think is valid then create a new issue with the message and I'll fix it if it's an actual bug.
